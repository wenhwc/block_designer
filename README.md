## 🚀 Key Features

- **Visual Logic Design**: Drag-and-drop interface for creating complex control loops.
- **Real-time Simulation**: Run high-fidelity simulations with immediate visual feedback.
- **Signal Monitor**: Integrated oscilloscope-style view for live telemetry.
- **Embedded Targeting**: Program and debug firmware directly on STM32 microcontrollers.
- **Hardware Validation**: Real-time checking of hardware resources and pin configurations.
- **Rich Library**: Comprehensive set of Math, Logic, Source, and Hardware blocks.
- **PDF Export**: Generate professional documentation of your designs.

## 🛠 Installation

### macOS
1. Download the `block_designer.dmg` from the [Releases](https://github.com/wenhwc/block_designer/releases) page.
2. Open the DMG file.
3. Drag **Block Designer** to your `Applications` folder.
4. Launch the app from your Applications or Spotlight.

### Windows / Linux
*(Installers for other platforms are coming soon. Check the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/wenhwc/block_designer) for updates.)*

## 📖 How to Use

1. **New Project**: Start a new design from the `File` menu.
2. **Library**: Drag blocks from the left-hand library into the workspace.
3. **Connections**: Click and drag from an output port to an input port to connect them.
4. **Properties**: Select a block to adjust its parameters (e.g., frequencies, gains, pins) in the right-hand panel.
5. **Simulation**: Click the **Simulate** button to run your logic and watch signals in the **Signal Monitor**.
6. **Hardware**: Connect your STM32 board and use the **Program** feature to flash your logic directly to the hardware.
